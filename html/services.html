        <p>
          EcoNautica organizes large-scale cleanup projects for rivers, lakes,
          oceans, and other water bodies. Using cutting-edge technology such as
          drones, aquatic robots, and eco-friendly filtration systems, we
          efficiently remove pollutants like plastics, oil, and industrial waste
          while minimizing disruption to local ecosystems.

          Beyond cleanup, we focus on restoring aquatic ecosystems to their
          natural state. Our team of marine biologists, environmental engineers,
          and local volunteers work to reintroduce native species, revitalize
          habitats, and ensure sustainable biodiversity.
